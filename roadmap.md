# The hiring manager’s mental checklist (this is key)

When I look at your portfolio, I’m asking:

1. Can this person reconstruct what happened?
2. Can they reason about *systems*, not just individuals?
3. Can they identify where prevention could have worked?
4. Can they write clearly and professionally?
5. Can they handle harm-related material without going off the rails?

Every project we design will answer those questions.

# PROJECT SET (curated, realistic, employable)

## PROJECT 1 (FOUNDATIONAL – MUST DO FIRST)

### **Title**

**Escalation Failure in Platform Safety: A Retrospective Analysis of the Uber Safety Crisis (2017–2019)**

### Why this one?

* Extremely well-known
* Rich public documentation
* Clearly about **harm prevention**
* Recruiters immediately recognize it
* No technical rabbit holes required

### Incident focus

Uber faced multiple public safety failures:

* Sexual assault reports
* Delayed response
* Poor escalation paths
* Reactive rather than proactive controls

### Your task (as the analyst)

You are **not** judging Uber morally.
You are analyzing **how the system failed**.

### What you must produce

* Incident timeline (high-level)
* Identification of failure modes:

  * Reporting friction
  * Escalation delays
  * Accountability gaps
* Contributing factors:

  * Incentive misalignment
  * Operational overload
  * Trust erosion
* Preventive interventions:

  * What Uber eventually implemented
  * What could have been implemented earlier
* Lessons transferable to other platforms

### Skills demonstrated

* Incident reconstruction
* Socio-technical systems thinking
* Harm prevention framing
* Professional writing

## PROJECT 2 (CORE – TRUST & SAFETY SIGNAL)

### **Title**

**Failure Modes in Abuse Reporting Systems: Lessons from Meta’s Handling of Non-Consensual Intimate Images**

### Why this one?

* Directly relevant to what emotionally matters to you
* Strong Trust & Safety signal
* Uses **public policy docs**, not live cases
* Shows restraint and professionalism

### Incident focus

* Historical criticism of Meta’s handling of NCII
* Delays in takedown
* Victim retraumatization
* Inconsistent enforcement

### Your task

Analyze the **system**, not offenders.

### What you must produce

* Description of the abuse category
* User journey analysis:

  * Victim reporting path
  * Where friction occurs
* Failure modes:

  * Delayed action
  * Poor feedback loops
  * Inadequate escalation
* Tradeoffs:

  * Speed vs accuracy
  * False positives vs harm
* Preventive controls:

  * Hash-based detection
  * Trusted flagger programs
  * Crisis escalation paths

## PROJECT 3 (OPERATIONS & ANALYSIS BRIDGE)

### **Title**

**Delayed Escalation in Contact Center Safety Incidents: A Case Study of Operational Risk**

### Why this one?

* Directly bridges your **current job context**
* Shows operational realism
* Very employable for entry-level roles

### Incident focus

Use a **composite, anonymized scenario**:

* Repeated reports of threatening behavior
* Agents follow SOPs, but harm still escalates
* No single “mistake” — systemic failure

### Your task

Act as an internal risk analyst reviewing a past incident.

### What you must produce

* Simplified incident narrative
* Process map of escalation
* Identification of:

  * Bottlenecks
  * Decision ambiguity
  * Signal loss
* Root cause analysis (not blame-based)
* Recommendations:

  * Process redesign
  * Training changes
  * Early warning indicators

### Skills demonstrated

* Operational analysis
* Process thinking
* Root cause analysis
* Practical recommendations

## PROJECT 4 (OPTIONAL – DIFFERENTIATOR)

### **Title**

**Threat Modeling Abuse at Scale: How Marketplaces Become Targets for Extortion and Harassment**

### Purpose

This is where your **adversarial thinking** starts to show — but safely.

### Focus

* How platforms are exploited
* Not specific perpetrators
* Generic abuse patterns

### Outputs

* Threat model
* Abuse scenarios
* System vulnerabilities
* Preventive design principles

This one can stay **unpublished initially**.

---

## PROJECT 5 (OPTIONAL – LONG-TERM SIGNAL)

### **Title**

**Early Warning Signals of Harm in Platform Operations**

Focus on:

* Weak signals
* Near-misses
* Leading indicators

This shows maturity, but it’s not required for first job.

---

# What NOT to include (important)

* OSINT screenshots
* Real names
* Live cases
* Moral language
* Rage
* Speculation

Your anger belongs in **motivation**, not **artifacts**.

# Final manager-style instruction to you

If you were on my team, I would tell you:

> “Do Project 1 first. Don’t overthink it. Write a bad first draft.
> Then improve it once.
> Then move on.
> Competence beats perfection.”

If you want, next we can:

* Fully scope **Project 1** line-by-line
* Write the **exact README** template
* Define a **30-day execution plan**
* Or simulate a recruiter reviewing this portfolio and poking holes in it

You’re no longer searching.
You’re building now.
