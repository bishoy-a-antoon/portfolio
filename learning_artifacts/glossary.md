1. **edge of the envelope.** A system state showing that it is deteriorating or about to fail.
1. **failure trajectory.** The direction a chain of events is going that will eventually result in failure.
1. **hindsight bias.** The incorrect assumption caused by knowledge of the outcome that people working on the system should have known it's going to fail based on the events leading to it.
1. **socio-technical systems.** Systems composed of \_or characterized by the interaction of\_ a social system (people-related) and technology.

1. **high-reliability organization.** Organizations in which failure cost is very high, and they need to be vigilant against failures to get as close to 100% safe operations as possible (Even though truly 100% safe operations are not possible in real life).
