# Ops Analysis, Risk, Safety & Reliability Portfolio


## Tier 1: Ops Analysis & Process Improvement
**Contact Center & Service Operations Focus**

### Overview

This portfolio demonstrates my ability to **analyze, stabilize, and improve service operations**, with a primary focus on **contact centers and BPO environments**.

My work focuses on identifying:

* Operational bottlenecks
* Performance leakage
* Process inconsistencies
* Preventable escalations
* Human-driven variability affecting service delivery

All projects are designed to reflect **real contact center challenges**, using practical data, operational metrics, and clear recommendations that can be implemented in live environments.

## What This Portfolio Represents

This portfolio is built around three core capabilities that are critical in BPO and service organizations:

### 1. Operational Performance Analysis

Understanding *why* performance fluctuates and *where* it breaks down.

### 2. Process & Workflow Improvement

Mapping real processes, identifying inefficiencies, and proposing structured improvements.

### 3. Service Stability & Consistency

Reducing operational risk by addressing repeat issues, rework, escalations, and agent strain.

## Tools & Methods Used

* Process Mapping (BPMN-style)
* Root Cause Analysis (5 Whys, Fishbone)
* KPI & Performance Analysis
* Qualitative & Quantitative Data Analysis
* Operational Documentation & SOP Review

*Tools are selected for clarity and applicability, not complexity.*

Each project is structured to clearly show:
**Problem → Analysis → Insight → Recommendation**
