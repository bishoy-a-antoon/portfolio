# Safety & Risk Analysis Portfolio

## Purpose

This portfolio demonstrates practical capability in:

* Operational Safety Analysis
* Non-Financial Risk Analysis
* Incident & Root Cause Analysis
* Trust & Safety

The focus is on:

* Human harm prevention

## Portfolio Structure

## Analytical Methods Used

Across projects, I apply:

* Incident analysis
* Root cause reasoning
* Failure mode identification
* Risk categorization
* Control gap analysis
* Qualitative severity and likelihood assessment

Methods are adapted for limited or messy data, incomplete public reporting, and real-world ambiguity
Assumptions and uncertainties are always stated explicitly.

---

## Ethical Framing

* All incidents are real and publicly reported
* No personal data is enriched or scraped
* No speculation about individual guilt
* Focus remains on system behavior, not blame

The goal is:

> *Understanding failure, not assigning fault.*
