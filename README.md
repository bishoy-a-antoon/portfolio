# Applied Harm & Crime Prevention Portfolio

**Modeling Coercion, Exploitation, and Violence — and Where Intervention Is Possible**

---

## 📌 Portfolio Overview

This portfolio is a modular, applied research program focused on **understanding and preventing coercive harm**.  
It models how grievance, ideology, sexual exploitation, and financial incentives evolve into real-world violence and organized crime.

Rather than studying isolated crimes, the portfolio treats harm as a **system**:

- how people are recruited
    
- how control is established
    
- how exploitation scales
    
- how violence emerges
    
- how systems fail
    
- and where prevention can be inserted
    

The portfolio consists of **five interlinked projects**, each addressing a different layer of the same harm ecosystem.

Together, they produce a **single integrated source of truth** about:

- coercive pipelines
    
- exploitation dynamics
    
- grievance-to-violence pathways
    
- financial flows
    
- and prevention strategies
    

---

## 🎯 Portfolio Goals

- Model coercion and exploitation as structured processes
    
- Identify early warning signals and escalation points
    
- Translate behavioral analysis into prevention logic
    
- Demonstrate applied reasoning suitable for Trust & Safety, NGOs, and security research
    
- Produce structured, reusable analytical artifacts

## 🧠 How the 5 Projects Tie Together

|Project|Core Question|
|---|---|
|1. Coercive Exploitation Pipeline|How does control over victims work at a systemic level?|
|2. Sexualized Power & Digital Exploitation|How does coercion become sexual exploitation and grooming?|
|3. Grievance to Violence|How does ideology and resentment turn into attacks?|
|4. Financialized Harm|How does exploitation turn into revenue and fund further crime?|
|5. Systems, Platforms & Prevention|Where does detection fail and intervention succeed?|

Each project contributes to a **shared analytical framework**.  
Their findings are consolidated into a unified **Harm Systems Model**.

## 📦 Final Unified Deliverable: “Harm Systems Model”

The results of all five projects feed into a single integrated artifact:

**Harm Systems Model (Source of Truth)**  
A structured representation of:

- pipelines of coercion
    
- escalation paths
    
- exploitation types
    
- financial flows
    
- and prevention levers
    

Deliverables include:

- Unified diagrams
    
- Taxonomies
    
- Threat models
    
- Intervention maps
    
- Glossary
    

This acts as:  
✔ research synthesis  
✔ prevention reference  
✔ portfolio showcase  
✔ conceptual framework
