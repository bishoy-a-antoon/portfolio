# Bishoy Adel's Portfolio

## About Me
A safety and risk analyst. I work on analyzing how operational and socio-technical systems fail — with a focus on preventing human harm before it escalates.

I am especially interested in incident reconstruction, risk scenario analysis, escalation failures, and human factors in complex systems such as online platforms, service operations, and large-scale digital services.

I focus on understanding how harm emerges — examining latent conditions, process gaps, decision pressures, and system blind spots that allow risk to compound over time.


## Portfolio Overview
This portfolio is centered on real-world incidents and credible safety analysis practices, with the goal of contributing to roles in Safety, Risk, Trust & Safety, and Incident Analysis environments.

## Ethics and Boundaries
