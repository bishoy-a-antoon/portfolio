# Trust & Safety Portfolio

This portfolio demonstrates structured analysis of online harms, platform policies, and moderation decision-making.

Focus areas:
- Misogyny and gender-based hostility
- Domestic and intimate partner violence
- Sexual exploitation and image-based abuse
- Crisis and self-harm signals

Each project examines:
- How harm manifests in online content

- How harm escalates
- How moderators and safety teams respond

This portfolio is intended for entry-level roles in:
- Content Moderation
- Trust & Safety Operations
- Safety Analysis
- Risk & Policy Review
- Quality / Investigation roles in BPO environments

No real victim data is used.
No graphic or explicit material is included.
All analysis is based on public policies and anonymized scenarios.
