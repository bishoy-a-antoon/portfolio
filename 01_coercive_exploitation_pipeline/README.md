# Project 01: Coercive Exploitation Pipeline

## Definition

The **Coercive Exploitation Pipeline** project defines a universal model for understanding how coercion operates across different forms of harm, from sexual exploitation to radicalization.  
The goal is to identify the **stages of control**, **leverage mechanisms**, and **compliance pathways** that allow perpetrators to manipulate victims, while remaining fully ethical and avoiding live or personally identifiable data.

This project serves as the **foundation** for the larger Applied Harm & Crime Prevention Portfolio, providing a structural framework that all other projects build upon.

---

## Deliverables

This project produces the following artifacts:

- **coercion_pipeline_model.md** – a structured pipeline showing stages from recruitment → grooming → control → compliance → harm.  
- **threat_escalation_diagram.md** – visualization of escalation pathways and triggers within coercive systems.  
- **control_mechanisms_typology.md** – taxonomy of tactics used by perpetrators to maintain leverage over victims.  
- **intervention_point_matrix.md** – matrix identifying points where prevention or intervention could disrupt the pipeline.

## Cases to Be Studied

Analysis focuses on **pattern-level studies** without identifying individuals. Examples include:

- Sextortion schemes (adults and minors, via online platforms)  
- Grooming networks  
- Cult coercion dynamics  
- Trafficking recruitment pipelines  
- Extremist recruitment pathways  
- Domestic coercion and abuse patterns  

Each case study will illustrate **how the pipeline manifests** in different domains.

## Roadmap (Detailed Checklist)

1. **Define coercion and control mechanisms**  
   - Survey literature on coercive control and psychological manipulation  
   - Identify core components across domains  

2. **Identify recruitment vectors**  
   - Platforms, forums, and networks used for recruitment  
   - Entry strategies and trust-building  

3. **Map grooming and trust-building stages**  
   - Identify escalation of emotional manipulation  
   - Define stages of dependency creation  

4. **Model leverage acquisition**  
   - Threats, blackmail, and social pressure mechanisms  
   - Financial, emotional, and social leverage  

5. **Map threat escalation pathways**  
   - Identify triggers for increased coercion  
   - Visualize escalation sequences  

6. **Map compliance dynamics**  
   - Behavioral patterns in victims  
   - Reinforcement strategies and cycle of control  

7. **Identify exit or collapse points**  
   - How pipelines fail or victims escape  
   - Recovery or de-escalation patterns  

8. **Create deliverable artifacts**  
   - `coercion_pipeline_model.md`  
   - `threat_escalation_diagram.md`  
   - `control_mechanisms_typology.md`  
   - `intervention_point_matrix.md`  

9. **Cross-reference with other portfolio projects**  
   - Link patterns to Sexualized Power & Digital Exploitation  
   - Link to Grievance to Violence for escalation insights  
   - Provide foundational context for Financialized Harm and Systems & Prevention

## Resources

- **Books & Literature**  
  - *The Gift of Fear* – Gavin de Becker  
  - *Without Conscience* – Robert D. Hare  
  - Coercive control research (Stark, 2007)  
  - Human trafficking frameworks  
  - Cult dynamics studies  

- **Online Resources**  
  - NGO reports on online abuse

## Usage

- This project can be **studied independently** or as part of the full portfolio.  
- Deliverables are designed for integration into the **Harm Systems Model**.  
- All analyses focus on **patterns, behaviors, and system dynamics**, not identifiable individuals.  
- Outputs can inform **prevention, intervention, and policy recommendations**.

---

## Notes

- Emphasis is on **applied, actionable analysis**.  
- Ethical boundaries: no scraping of live cases, no engagement with perpetrators or victims.  
- Modular design ensures each artifact can be updated independently as research progresses.
