# Intervention Mapping

## Overview
This is a breakdown of confirmed safety interventions implemented by Uber.

Examples:
* In-app emergency button
* Share-trip feature
* Audio recording
* Background check updates
* Transparency reporting
* Safety hotlines

For each intervention, I have attempted to answer the following questions:
* What risk was it trying to address?
* Was it preventive, detective, or responsive?
* What failure mode does it not cover?
