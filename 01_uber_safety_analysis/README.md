# Public-Signal Safety Analysis of Ride-Hailing Platforms: Uber Case Study (2014–2023)

## Scope

* Patterns of harm reported publicly
* Signals that indicated risk escalation
* Organizational responses & interventions
* Gaps between harm and mitigation

---

## Project Structure

### Harm Domain Defintion
Sexual assault & passenger safety risks

### Public Signals Analysis (Pattern Recognition)
* News investigations
* Court cases (complaints, verdicts)
* NGO reports
* Uber transparency / safety reports
* Regulatory actions
* Congressional hearings
* Wikipedia (used for source collection)

### Intervention Mapping: Confirmed Safety Interventions Implemented by Uber
Examples:
    * In-app emergency button
    * Share-trip feature
    * Audio recording
    * Background check updates
    * Transparency reporting
    * Safety hotlines
For each intervention, I have attempted to answer the following questions
    1. What risk was it trying to address?
    2. Was it preventive, detective, or responsive?
    3. What failure mode does it *not* cover?

### Failure Mode Analysis
Examples:
* Victims unwilling to report
* Cultural barriers
* Delayed response despite tools
* Driver misuse of platform
* Overreliance on post-incident tools

This is an attempt to identify system limits.

### Recommendations
Examples:
* Improved feedback loops between reports and product changes
* Better public risk communication
* Independent audits of safety features
* NGO partnerships for victim support

### Executive Summary
A summary/memo of the whole project to be presented to stakeholders.
